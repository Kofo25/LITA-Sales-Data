# LITA-Sales-Data
My First Project with the Ladies in Tech Africa and the Incubator Hub.

### Project Title : Sales Data Analysis
---

### Project Overview
This Data Analysis project aims to analyze the Sales performance of some given products over the past 2 years. By analyzing the various parameters in the data received we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions which will enable us to tell compelling stories around the data and to provide us with the insights of the best performance of our data.

### Data Source
The primary source of Data used here is LITA CAPSTONE PROJECT which was shared as part of my project portfolio. Itâ€™s an Excel form.

### Tools Used
- Ms Excel for;
  1. Data Cleaning
  2. Analysis
  3. Visualization

- SQL Server for Querying and Analysis

- Power BI for Data Visualization and Analysis

- GitHub for Portfolio Building

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
In the First phase of the Data Cleaning and Preparation, we make use of the Microsoft Excel to perform a set of actions such as;
- Loading and Inspection of Data

- Performing Excel functions to create new data or variables/ calculate metrics

- Data Cleaning and Formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
This involves the exploration of data to answer some questions about the data such as;
- Top-selling products
- Regional performance
- Monthly sales trends

### Data Analysis
This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries or even some Excel Functions and even DAX expressions used during the analysis;
```
=SUM(F4*G4)
```
The above Excel Function was used to calculate the Sales of Each product sold.

 Then next in calculating the Total Sales By Region I made use of the SUMIF Function and for the Average Sales per Product i made use of the AVERAGEIF Function with the results of each Excel function see in the above table.

### SQL Query Codes
In the process of our Data Analysis we made use of the Structured Query Language SQL to extract key insights and to retrive valuable information from the Sales Data.
Below are the queries used for extracting this Key insights;
```
select SUM(Revenue)as TotalSales, Product from SalesData
group by Product
```
This Query was used in finding the Total revenue for each product sold.
```
select COUNT(OrderId)as TotalSales, Region from SalesData
group by Region
```
This Query is used to determine the number of sale transactions done in each region.
```
Select SUM (Revenue)as HighestSellingP,Product from SalesData
group by Product
order by HighestSellingP DESC
```
The above Query is for determining the highest selling product.
```
select COUNT(OrderId)as Total_Sales, Product from SalesData
group by Product
```
In finding the total sales for each product we made use of this Query Code.
```
